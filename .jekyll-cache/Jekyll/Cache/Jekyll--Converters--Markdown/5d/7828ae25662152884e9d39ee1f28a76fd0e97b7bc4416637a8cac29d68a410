I"<p>On May 8, 2019, the venerable Monterey Bay Aquarium social media team asked its followers to name their favorite ocean critters.</p>

<p>This project could have stayed on Twitter but I was curious to see what the responses were, quantitatively, so I ran an analysis on the tweets.</p>

<p>That was interesting, but still left something to be desired: interactivity. This next figure shows the history of occurrence of certain favorite critters. That is, how many favorites did tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/MontereyAq">@MontereyAq</a> garner? Bubble size illustrates the number of favorites received from given tweet with mention of that critter. If you hover over the bubbles, a link to the tweet will pop up (though this feature is a little jumpy so you have to click a few times before it works).</p>
