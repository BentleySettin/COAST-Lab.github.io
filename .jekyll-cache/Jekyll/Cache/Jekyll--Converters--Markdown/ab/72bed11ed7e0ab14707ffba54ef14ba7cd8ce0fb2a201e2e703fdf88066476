I"<p>We are very curious to see what we can learn from finer scale biogeochemical observations than are typically conducted, especially in dynamic coastal and estuarine environments. Autonomous sensors are typically situated kilometers or further apart, but it is well known that significant variability can occur at meter or finer scales. Toward this goal, we are developing instrumentation for mobile platforms, including human-powered watercraft like paddleboards and surfboards (see also <a href="../smartfin">Smartfin</a>).</p>
