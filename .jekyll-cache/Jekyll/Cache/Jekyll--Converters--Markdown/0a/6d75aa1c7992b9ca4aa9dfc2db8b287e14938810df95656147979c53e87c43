I"¾<p>Greetings. Some of my earliest memories are taking family vacations from my hometown in Iowa to the Atlantic Coast to visit the beach. I was enthralled by the ocean. Years later, in college, I studied abroad in the Galapagos Islands where I began to study marine science.</p>

<p>I soon involved myself with <a href="https://www.coralrestoration.org/">Coral Restoration Foundation</a> in the Florida Keys, whose core mission is to restore the Florida Reef Tract and to educate others on the importance of our oceans. I want to further my education so that I can better understand the ocean and monitor its stressors.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to be a Graduate Student in the department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, getting my Masterâ€™s in Marine Science and working in the COAST Lab. When my nose is not in a book, I enjoy running, cycling, cooking, geocaching, and scuba diving. The best part is, I no longer have to drive 18 hours to get to the beach.</p>
