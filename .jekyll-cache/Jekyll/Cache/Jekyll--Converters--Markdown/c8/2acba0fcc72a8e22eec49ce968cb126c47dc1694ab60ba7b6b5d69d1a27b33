I"•<p>My name is Daniel Portelli. I am an undergrad at UNCW obtaining my bachelors in Oceanography. I am currently doing research on remote sensor development and deployment.
While I am passionate about technology, and how it can be applied to better understand our ocean, my greatest interest is in biology. I plan to study marine invertebrate intelligence.</p>
