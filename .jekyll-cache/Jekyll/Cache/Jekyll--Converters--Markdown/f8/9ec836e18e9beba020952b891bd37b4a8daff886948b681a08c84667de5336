<p>The Coastal Ocean Applied Science &amp; Technology Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (affiliated with the <a href="https://uncw.edu/earsci/">Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences<a></a> and <a href="https://uncw.edu/cms/">Center for Marine Science<a></a>) seeks to find answers to and develop solutions for our most pressing environmental questions and problems. We focus mostly on coastal and estuarine environments and use a combination of engineering and applied science approaches. Our tools include (1) existing sensors and our own inventions paired with buoys, profilers, ships, and autonomous vessels for in situ monitoring, (2) satellites and drones for remote sensing, and (3) techniques including time-series analysis and machine learning approaches to better understand the changing ocean. We frequently post open code and other design files to GitHub and we rely heavily on others’ contributions to the free and open source ecosystem as well.</a></a></p>

<p>Topics of interest include (but aren’t limited to!): carbon cycling, ocean acidification, deoxygenation, and eutrophication; the effects of human activity on water quality; low-cost sensor development to facilitate public participation in scientific research and expanded monitoring networks; platform development and sensor integration for novel sensing approaches.</p>

<p><strong>We are actively seeking new undergraduate and graduate students.</strong> Potential undergraduate student researchers: please reach out to me at bresnahanp@uncw.edu to explore opportunities for a Directed Independent Study (DIS), Honors Thesis, or other ways of getting involved in COAST Lab research. Potential graduate student researchers: please take a look at the <a href="https://uncw.edu/mms/">M.S. in Marine Science<a></a> and <a href="https://uncw.edu/msgeoscience/">M.S. in Geoscience<a></a> options and reach out if one of those and COAST Lab research are of interest. The primary quality we seek in students is curiosity. While lab members use skills like coding, 3D design and printing, laboratory analyses, etc., we do not expect that candidates will have prior experience in these. Rather, we seek to teach new skills to those who are excited to put the time and effort into learning them and applying them toward specific scientific and engineering challenges.</a></a></p>
