I"¢<p>We are always striving to invent new technologies, especially in the low-cost and open source spaces. Main scientific topics of interest include: blue carbon and ocean acidification, eutrophication, and other water quality issues. More specifically, we are working on sensors and analyzers to measure pH, pCO2, O2, total dissolved inorganic carbon, chlorophyll fluorescence, colored dissolved organic matter, and turbidity/backscattering. You can find much more information about these under the Peer-Reviewed publications header of the <a href="../cv/#peer-reviewed-publications">CV page</a>.</p>

<p>We currently have several sensors under development; here are some short descriptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one that estimates âˆ†pCO2 using a single, low-cost CO2 sensor (manuscript in prep);</li>
  <li>one that measures water level using â‰ˆ $100 in parts and produces data of comparable quality to commercial instrumentation (manuscript in press; GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/SUPScientist/Seaport_Tide-SLR">here</a>);</li>
  <li>a multi-parameter bio-optical sensor based off of open source designs in the literature (more on this soon!);</li>
  <li>and another that combines off-the-shelf water quality instrumentation in a comparatively low-cost multiparameter sensor (https://github.com/SUPScientist/atlas-water-quality-withSD).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please check back for updates as these technologies continue to evolve!</p>
