I"ù<p>This course is formally called Advanced Oceanography but I think of it as the first exposure for many into the world of Quantitative Oceanography. We follow the lead of Sea Change: 2015‚Äì2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21655/sea-change-2015-2025-decadal-survey-of-ocean-sciences">https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21655/sea-change-2015-2025-decadal-survey-of-ocean-sciences</a> which is a fantastic summary of the state of ocean science as well as future priorities (though, admittedly, it is rapidly becoming somewhat outdated!). We analyze open datasets, including time-series data from BATS, profile data from Argo, and fisheries data from Peru, among others, and develop group projects that hone in on students‚Äô own oceanographic interests. We also dedicate a substantial portion of the semester to the theme of Ocean Solutions, drawing on reports from Project Drawdown <a href="https://drawdown.org/programs/drawdown-learn">https://drawdown.org/programs/drawdown-learn</a> and the Ocean Panel‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlue Papers‚Äù: <a href="https://www.oceanpanel.org/ocean-science#reports">https://www.oceanpanel.org/ocean-science#reports</a>.</p>
