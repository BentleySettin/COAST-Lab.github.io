### SELECTED MEDIA COVERAGE
I enjoy opportunities to discuss some of what I think are the world's most pressing (environmental) issues. But, more important than my own fulfillment, I believe that it is very important to get scientific and engineering knowledge out of our labs and universities. Here are a few of my favorite clips.
