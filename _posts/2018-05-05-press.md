### SELECTED MEDIA COVERAGE
I enjoy opportunities to discuss some of what I think are the world's most pressing (environmental) issues. But, far more important than my own fulfillment, it is very important to get scientific and engineering knowledge out of our labs and universities! Here are a few of my favorite clips.
