# Patrick Connell
Hi! I'm Patrick Connell. I graduated from UNCW in December 2022 with an M.S in Geoscience, with my research focused on remote sensing and GIS applications in wetland prediction and modeling. 
I am currently employed at UNCW as a research specialist working in the UAS Coastal Observatory as well as the COAST lab. My background consists of water quality and wetland research. When I'm not working I can likely be found on the many creeks, rivers, and estuaries that surround the greater Wilmington area.
