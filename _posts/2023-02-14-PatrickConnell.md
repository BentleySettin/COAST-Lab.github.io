Spending the larger part of my life on the coast, I've developed a passion for water, both fresh and salt. I am a recent graduate from UNC Wilmington with an M.S in Geoscience. My research focused on remote sensing and GIS applications in wetland prediction and modeling. I am currently employed at UNC Wilmington as a research specialist working in the UAS Coastal Observatory as well as the COAST lab. When I'm not working I can likely be found on the many creeks, rivers, and estuaries that surround the greater Wilmington area.
