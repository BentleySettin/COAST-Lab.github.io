I'm Adam, a graduate of the M.S. Marine Science program at UNCW with a background in biogeochemistry. My master's thesis focused on using optical parameters to determine the source, fate, and transport of dissolved organic matter in the Cape Fear River under various conditions. Currently, I'm working in the COAST lab as a volunteer, interested in low-cost biogeochemical sensor development and looking into starting a Ph.D. next fall. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, rock climbing, snowboarding, and various other outdoor activities.
