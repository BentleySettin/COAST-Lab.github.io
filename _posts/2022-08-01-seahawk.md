We were recently awarded a multi-institution, academic/government/industry collaborative grant from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation to use the satellite ocean color imagery from the SeaHawk/HawkEye project for high-resolution coastal water quality analyses. 

Check out the SeaHawk/HawkEye page on the NASA Ocean Color Website for more information and access to our NASA-processed and hosted data archive: [oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/hawkeye/](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/hawkeye/).
