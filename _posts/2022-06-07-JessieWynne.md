I began my Masters of Marine Science at UNCW in the Fall of 2022. I began working in the COAST Lab working with Dr. Bresnahan in the Summer of '22. I recieved my BS in Biology and minored in Chemistry at Messiah University. 

I am focusing on Chl sensors and deveoping a way to communicate their data to a Adalogger to view via their data via an SD card. This will allow for the Chl sensors to be monitored remotely. 

In the past I have worked on projects such as herbaceous growth in aqauponic systems, as well as tree seedling regeneration after forest fires. Working with biological systems has allowed me to have an in-depth unerstanding of how differing nutrient levels can impact ecosystems.
