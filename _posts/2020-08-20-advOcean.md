This course is formally called Advanced Oceanography but I think of it as the first exposure for many into the world of Quantitative Oceanography. We follow the lead of Sea Change: 2015--2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences [https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21655/sea-change-2015-2025-decadal-survey-of-ocean-sciences](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21655/sea-change-2015-2025-decadal-survey-of-ocean-sciences) which is a fantastic summary of the state of ocean science as well as future priorities (though, admittedly, it is rapidly becoming somewhat outdated!). We analyze open datasets, including time-series data from BATS, profile data from Argo, and fisheries data from Peru, among others, and develop group projects that hone in on students' own oceanographic interests. We also dedicate a substantial portion of the semester to the theme of Ocean Solutions, drawing on reports from Project Drawdown [https://drawdown.org/programs/drawdown-learn](https://drawdown.org/programs/drawdown-learn) and the Ocean Panel's "Blue Papers": [https://www.oceanpanel.org/ocean-science#reports](https://www.oceanpanel.org/ocean-science#reports). 

Many of the exercises we complete (modified from the 2020 Data Labs Virtual Research Experience for Undergraduates, hosted by Rutgers University) can be found at [https://github.com/SUPScientist/datalab-reu-2020](https://github.com/SUPScientist/datalab-reu-2020).
