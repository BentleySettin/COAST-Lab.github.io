Hi! My name is Hailey Seppey, I am a senior at UNCW studying Oceanography with a minor in Marine Biology. This semester I am doing a DIS in the COASTS lab focusing on refining the Sea Level Rise project. I care greatly about the fate of our environment and hope to find new ways to improve its current and predicted future condition.
