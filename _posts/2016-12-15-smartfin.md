Smartfin is an Internet of Things surfboard fin equipped with oceanographic sensors and a program designed to give environmental health advocates a way to contribute to cutting edge science just by doing what they love: surfing!

Here's a data visualization that I made to show off some of Smartfin's capabilities. One of the surfers in this video is equipped with a Smartfin and is collecting temperature, motion, and position data while surfing. If you watch closely, you can probably guess which one by seeing who is riding waves when the graph of speed (MPH) shows large peaks!

As head of R&D, I am designing new sensors and scientific applications for Smartfin and planning on integrating it with alternate "platforms of opportunity," such as kayaks, sailboats, scuba gear, etc. I am developing the Smartfin's core firmware and hardware in order to take advantage of ever-evolving wireless data transfer technologies. With global cellular connectivity, Smartfin will be able to transmit data to the cloud almost as soon as the surfer exits the water, enabling near-real-time coastal data analytics. I am also adapting/miniaturizing technology (e.g., pH and dissolved oxygen sensors) from the [WavepHOx](../sup-science) in order to enable biogeochemical research using Smartfins.

### Smartfin Surfrider Team Surfs
On April 28th, 2018, a small but mighty team of [Surfrider Foundation San Diego Chapter](https://www.facebook.com/surfriderSD/) Smartfin riders gathered north of the OB Pier to collect data en masse. As a simple example of our technological capabilities, I put together these interactive figures so that anyone could explore the collected data. We're working to improve our project's website to include these types of features automatically but, in the meantime, check out this map and interactive time-series plot! Thanks for coming out, everybody!

Please explore the project's official website at [smartfin.org](https://smartfin.org) and this storymap I made (below; [full link here--it looks _way_ better in fullscreen mode)](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=7d74aeff9683496297059217e853bff7#storymap) for much more info.
