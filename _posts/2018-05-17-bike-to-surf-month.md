Exploration seems to imply--if not require--some sort of long journey. Usually at least one flight or road trip and probably a different time zone. It doesn't have to. In fact, perhaps responsible exploration and tourism shouldn't require long journeys at all.

I know I'm not alone when I say that I'd like to go on an adventure but struggle to figure out how, when, and where. I've long dreamed of biking across a continent and paddling a country's coastline. Maybe someday I'll do at least one of those. But, for now, my plan is to chase micro-adventures: little trips with smaller carbon footprints that don't require putting the rest of my life on hold.

I'm calling the first one *Bike to Surf Month*. My goal is, rather simply, to surf a different break in San Diego County every day in the month of June, getting to each using only my bike. It might not sound like much, but with ???? miles of roads and paths separating the northernmost from southernmost SD breaks and a full-time job, it should keep me busy and give me an opportunity to explore one of the world's nicest coastlines in a comparatively unintrusive way.

I'm going to make measurements along the way. [My research](../.) revolves around building ocean sensor networks to improve our understanding of natural and human-caused chemical changes. I'll bring a [Smartfin](../smartfin) to investigate temperature variability and a custom CO<sub>2</sub> sensor (more on that in a future post) to observe both land and sea dynamics along my routes.

My plan is to hit thirty different breaks along the ~ 50 mile stretch from the Mexican border to Orange County, focusing on those closer to home (Pacific Beach) on week days and the more distant ones on weekends. I don't have it all scoped out yet but, as a start, the map above shows many of San Diego's iconic breaks (according to Magic Seaweed (thanks for getting their coordinates, Alan!)). They're all shown as empty dots now but, as I go, I'll fill them in and include my data. I'll post (using #biketosurf and #biketosurfmonth) rough plans for each morning session the night before. I hope you'll join me with bike and board for a few waves!
