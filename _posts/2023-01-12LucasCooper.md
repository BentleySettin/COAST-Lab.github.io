Hello my name is Luke Cooper. I am a undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. 
I am studying oceanography.
I will assist Elizabeth Farquhar in âˆ†pCO2 sensor development in the COAST Lab during the Fall semester.
My interests lay in conservation, ecology, chemistry, and biology; all which rely on sensors and technology.
