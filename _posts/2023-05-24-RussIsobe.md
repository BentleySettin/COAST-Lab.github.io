I am an undergrad student majoring in Oceanography, and minoring in Geology.  I will be working with Dr. Bresnahan on developing a low-cost turbidity meter.  As an avid surfer, I love the ocean and strive to leave it better than I found it (Hence why I picked my Major).  I served 7 years in the US Army, where I was an Airborne Infantryman.  In my free time I enjoy surfing, traveling, hiking, and spending time with my wife and daughter.
