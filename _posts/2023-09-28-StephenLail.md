My name is Stephen Lail and I am a Marine Science Master's Student working in the COAST Lab with Dr. Bresnahan.

I received my Bachelor's of Science in Geology from UNC Charlotte. While there I had the opportunity to work in the experimental geochemistry lab where I studied how seafloor weathering would cause the addition of Phosphorus to the Phosphorus cycle when under anoxic conditions.

I have done CO~2~ research in the past with a non-profit called Vesta where Olivine sand could be used to sequester Carbon through enhanced coastal weathering. My role was to perform particle size analysis on the sediments at their field locations in Duck, NC and in the Hamptons, NY.
For my Master's degree, I hope to study CO~2~ along with other biogeochemical processes.
