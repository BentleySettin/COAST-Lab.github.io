*Spring 2021* 

This class isnâ€™t as much about learning about our planet as it is about learning about how we learn about our planet. That is, what tools do oceanographers use in order to study and describe what they are learning about the ocean.

The semester's main assignment will be planning and executing a field expedition, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting your results. I hope to keep the class as hands-on and interactive as possible as this is very much a learn-by-doing topic. I do not expect you to have practice in many of the techniques that we will cover--just a curiosity and motivation to learn more.
