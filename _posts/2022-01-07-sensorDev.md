We are always striving to invent new technologies, especially in the low-cost and open source spaces. Main scientific topics of interest include: blue carbon and ocean acidification, eutrophication, and other water quality changes. More specifically, we are working on sensors and analyzers to measure pH, pCO2, O2, total dissolved inorganic carbon, chlorophyll fluorescence, colored dissolved organic matter, and turbidity/backscattering. You can find much more information about these under the Peer-Reviewed publications header of the [CV page](../cv/#peer-reviewed-publications).
