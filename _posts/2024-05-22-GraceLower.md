Hello! My name is Grace Lower, and I'm a rising senior at UNC Chapel Hill studying Environmental Health Science in the Gillings School of Global Public Health. I am incredibly excited to be working in The COAST Lab this summer and to be exploring the intersections between environmental science, oceanography, human health, and engineering!

I am originally from Wake Forest, NC (outside of Raleigh) and grew up visiting North Carolina's vast mountains and many beaches each summer, instilling in me an appreciation for the natural world and its relationship with humanity from a young age. I am honored and ready to contribute to real, meaningful research that serves to help the environment and communities that depend on it.

Beyond academia, my passions include dance and fitness; I have danced competitively for around 17 years, serve as president of my dance team at UNC, and teach group fitness classes through UNC Campus Recreation and private studios across NC. Additionally, I adore traveling, reading, hiking, and spending time outdoors (that one's a given!).

Thanks for reading a little bit about me, and feel free to reach out (glower@unc.edu) or connect (https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-lower/).
