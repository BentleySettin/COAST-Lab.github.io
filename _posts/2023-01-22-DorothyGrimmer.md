Hi! I'm Dorothy Sue Grimmer! I am a junior studying marine biology. My DIS focuses on analyzing the images received from UNCW's Hawkeye satellite to understand chlorophyll patterns and how to best capture ocean color. I hope to have a career studying climate science, particularly how the ocean plays a role in climate regulation and is affected by climate change.
