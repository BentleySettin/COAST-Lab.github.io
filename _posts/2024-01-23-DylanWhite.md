I am a undergraduate student at UNCW, majoring in geology and oceanography. My goals are to study and work in Earth and ocean sciences to explore and find my passion. 

I am doing a DIS with Dr. Bresnahan to gain experince and help improve on the Seaport Water Level and Sea Level Rise Monitor. See more of my work here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Open-Water-Level/tree/main.
